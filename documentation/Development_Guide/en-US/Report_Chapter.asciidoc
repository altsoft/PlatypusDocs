Introduction to reports
-----------------------

The reporting tools allows a developer to generate reports as a
Microsoft Excel files. You can open a generated report in a spreadsheet
application, print or save it to disk.

`ReportTemplate` is an Platypus.js API class representing a report template. 
It is used in regular Platypus.js modules.

The report application element includes the following:

* a report template (a file in the Microsoft Excel format with the
`.xlsx` extension,
* JavaScript code,
* a data model.

Reports generator is based on the jXLS library, which in turn uses the Apache POI
library. Markup and formatting of the report are defined in the template
file. Binding to data is performed using jXLS library tags placed in
spreadsheet cells.

In the process of report generation, template tags are linked to model
entity's data arrays as well as to JavaScript objects.

[[new-report-creation]]
New report creation
-------------------

To create a report, perform the following actions:

* Select a New item in the parent directory context menu, or select the
parent directory and click New File in the main menu, or click New File
on the toolbar, or use a corresponding shortcut.
* Select a Report type in the context menu, or select Choose file type
Platypus application elements Report on the wizard first step and click
Next.
* Enter the name of a new application element in the Name field and
click Finish to create it, or click Cancel to cancel.

[[reports-editor]]
Reports editor
--------------

To open reports editor, double-click the application element in the
project tree.

Edit the report template in the spreadsheet application. The following
applications are used by default for different operating systems:

* Windows: Microsoft Excel.
* Linux: Open/Libre Office Calc.
* Mac OS: Microsoft Excel.

To edit a report:

* Open the Layout tab of the report editor, run the template editor by
clicking Edit report template.
* Specify the report formatting, add tags of linking to data to the
template, save the report template in the template editor application.
* On the Datamodel and Source tabs configure the data model and write
the JavaScript code.
* Implement report `onBeforeRender` event handler in the JavaScript
editor.
* Save the application element by clicking Save All on the Platypus
Application Designer toolbar or by clicking the Ctrl S shortcut.

[[template-tags]]
Template tags
-------------

Edit the report template in a spreadsheet application.

Place tags for linking to JavaScript objects and model entities'
data arrays in the template cells. To access data, use the following
syntax: $\{propertyName}, where propertyName is the object's property
of object accessible to report generator. Report generator has access
to object, that is passed to P.loadTemplate(modeulName, object) as second argument.

Example of writing the name of a documents into cells:

[source,Javascript]
----------------- 
${documents.name}
-----------------

Such a template will lead to insertion of multiple rows in a resulting
spreadsheet. Each row will represent documents collection item.

Similarly, you can use a complex object:

[source,Javascript]
------------------------- 
${library.documents.name}
-------------------------

You can use multiple tags in a single cell, for example:

[source,Javascript]
--------------------------------------------------

Employee: ${employee.name} - ${employee.age} years
--------------------------------------------------

In the JavaScript code, define objects, which will be available in the
template tags:

[source,Javascript]
------------------------------------ 
function reportA {
    var library = {};
    var template = P.loadTemplate(this.constructor.name, library);

    library.docs = this.model.documents;
    library.documents = [
        {name:'foo'}, 
        {name:'bar'},
        {name:'baz'}
    ];
}
------------------------------------

Add entities, which will be linked to the template, to the report module data
model.

When outputting collections, a new row is added for each collection
element and the style of a cell, which contains tag, is set for the
cells of this row.

If you know the size of the collection beforehand, you can use the
template rows instead of adding new rows for each element. To do this,
add name of the collection to fixed property of a temlate (variable `rt` in the above example).

There is another way yo display collections using the `jx:forEach` tag:

[source,Javascript]
----------------------------------------------------

<jx:forEach items="${departments}" var="department">
  ${department.name} | ${department.chief}
</jx:forEach>
----------------------------------------------------

The `jx` tags may be embedded into each other. If you place opening and
closing tags on the same row, columns in this row will be duplicated.
Place the `jx:forEach` and `jx:forEach` tags on different rows to enable
duplication of rows between these tags. Other cells in rows, which
contain opening and closing tags, will be ignored.

The `jx:forEach` tag allows grouping of collection data by one of the
properties. To arrange grouping, use the groupBy and groupOrder,
attributes, which determine the property to be used for grouping data
and the order of outputting groups, for example:

[source,Javascript]
----------------------------------------------------

<jx:forEach items="${employees}" groupBy="age">
  Age: ${group.item.age}
  <jx:forEach items="${group.items}" var="employee">
    ${employee.name} |
    ${employee.payment} |
    ${employee.bonus}
  </jx:forEach>
</jx:forEach>
----------------------------------------------------

In this example, we group employees by age. When grouping, a new group
object is created in the context of the cycle. This object contains two
properties: item, which is the current group, and items, which is the
collection of all objects in the group.

By default, if the groupOrder attribute is not present when grouping,
the original order of items in the collection is maintained. Use the
groupOrder attribute and assign `asc` and `desc` values for forward and
reverse sorting to this attribute.

If the groupBy attribute is used in the `jx:forEach` tag, the var
attribute is ignored.

Use the select attribute to determine elements of the collection which
should be included into the report. In the example below, we include
only employees with salary greater than 2000 into the report:

[source,Javascript]
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

<jx:forEach items="${employees}" var="employee" select="${employee.payment > 2000}">
 ${employee.name} | ${employee.payment} | ${employee.bonus}
</jx:forEach>
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

To get access to the index of the current collection element, use the
varStatus, attribute and set the name of the object, to which the status
object will be assigned, for this attribute. The status object have only
an index property, for example:

[source,Javascript]
-------------------------------------------------------------------

<jx:forEach items="${employees}" var="employee" varStatus="status">
 | ${status.index} 
 | ${employee.name} 
 | ${employee.payment} 
 | ${employee.bonus}
</jx:forEach>
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Use the `jx:if` tag to control output depending on the condition:

[source,Javascript]
---------------------------------------------------

<jx:if test="${department.chief.payment > 2000.0}">
Chief Name: ${department.chief.name}
</jx:if>
---------------------------------------------------

You can use the `jx:if` tag to show or hide columns; to do this, place
opening and closing tags in the same row â€” when exporting data, columns
contained in the body of the tag will be displayed or hidden.

Use the `jx:outline` tag to group rows:

[source,Javascript]
------------------------- 
<jx:outline>
   //any rows can go here
</jx:outline>
-------------------------

The `jx:outline` tag has an optional detail attribute, which determines
the state of the row group. By default, it is set to `false`, which
means that the row group will be hidden.

[[report-api]]
Report API
----------

To generate a report, create a report object by passing the required
report identifier to P.loadTemplate function.

Use the report object:

* Create an report instance using generateReport() method of ReportTemplate on the server side.
* Display a report by calling the show method. The report will be
downloaded and a command to open it will be executed.
* Send the report to print by calling the print method.
* Save the report file to disk by calling the save method; pass the path
of the file, to which the report should be saved, as a parameters.

_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________
*Note*

When executing the report in the HTML5 browser client, calling the
show(), print(), and save(reportPath) methods lead to the same results, -
the report file will be downloaded by your browser.
_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________

In the example below, the report is generated on client side by desktop
appliction:

[source,Javascript]
-----------------------------------------------------------

var r = new DocumentReport();
r.execute('business'); // generate report
-----------------------------------------------------------

To execute the report on the server side (from a HTML5 browser or a
desktop client):

[source,Javascript]
----------------------------------------------------------

/*
 * @stateless
 * @public
 */
function DocumentReport(){
    var self = this
        , model = P.loadModel(this.constructor.name)
        , template = P.loadTemplate(this.constructor.name, model);
    // take parameter's value from self property.
    self.execute = function(aValue, onSuccess, onFailure){
        model.documents.params.documentCategory = aValue;
        model.requery(function(){
            var report = template.generateReport();
            onSuccess(report);
        }, onFailure);
    }
    // ...
}

var r = new ServerModule('DocumentReport');
// provide some property to be taken as a model parameter
// by the report at the server side
r.execute('business', function(aReport){
    aReport.show();
}); 
----------------------------------------------------------

Report's JavaScript code prepares data for displaying, calculating new
data, etc.

* Write code in the report's module constructor to perform initialization.
* For server-side reports think about what data should be transferred to
the server side and provide arguments of method, performing generateReport.
