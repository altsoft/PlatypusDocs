HTTP interface
--------------

Server modules instance methods can be remotely invoked over network
using simple GET or POST HTTP requests.

To make the module instance methods available for external requests,
mark it with the `@public` annotation.

To invoke a server method, send a request by the URL formed using the
base URL of the Servlet and the `/api` suffix for accessing HTTP API.

Specify the request type, the module name, the method name and
parameters of method calling in the URL parameters or in the body of the
POST request in the application/x-www-form-urlencoded format. The
request body will contain a value, which was returned in the executed
method.

If the JavaScript object is returned from an instance method, it will be
serialized as JSON and string will be sent to a client as a response. If
the object of the String or XML type is returned, string response will
be sent to a client. It is also possible to specify the response content
type explicitly.

Parameters of the server module method inocation request:

[cols="<,<",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Parameter |Description
|`__type` |Request type. To execute the server module method, this
parameter should be set to `14`.

|`__moduleName` |Module identifier.

|`__methodName` |Name of the called module method.

|`__param` |Method's single parameter. A single value, a string, a
number or a serialized JavaScript object in the JSON format.

|`__param[]` |Method's multiply parameters. Several values, value can be
a string, a `Number` or a serialized JavaScript objects in JSON format.
|=======================================================================

Example of URL for calling a server module method (URL is not encoded):

http://server/platypus/application/api?__type=14&__moduleName=TestModule&__methodName=say&__param[]=Hello%20Platypus&__param[]=1[http://server/platypus/application/api?__type=14&__moduleName=TestModule&__methodName=say&__param[]=Hello
Platypus&__param[]=1]

HTTP request and response API
-----------------------------

To access HTTP request and response in the JavaScript server code, use
the `http` property, which is available, if the method is called by the
external HTTP request.

code,JavaScript------------------------------------------------
code,JavaScript
/**
 * @public
 */
function ModuleConstructor() {
   var self = this;
   
  /**
   * @rolesAllowed tester admin
   */
   this.doSomething = function(paramA, paramB) {
      // Use self.http property
   }
}
------------------------------------------------

The `http` property contains the following objects:

[cols="<,<",options="header",]
|=================================
|Property |Description
|`request` |HTTP request object.
|`response` |HTTP response object.
|=================================

The `request` object contains the following properties:

[cols="<,<",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Property |Description
|`authType` |Authentication scheme name.

|`characterEncoding` |Character encoding name.

|`contentLength` |Request body length in bytes or -1, if the length is
unknown.

|`contentType` |MIME type of the request body or `null` if the type is
unknown.

|`body` |Request body as a string.

|`bodyBuffer` |Request body as a bytes array.

|`contextPath` |Part of URL, the request context.

|`cookies` |Cookies which were sent by the client in the request in
key-value form.

|`headers` |Request headers in key-value form.

|`localAddr` |IP address, on which the request was received.

|`localName` |Ð˜ame of the host, on which the request was received.

|`localPort` |Port, on which the request was received.

|`method` |Request method HTTP name, for example `GET`, `POST`.

|`params` |Request parameters in key-value form. If several parameters
have the same name, their values will be presented as an array.

|`pathInfo` |Additional information about the path in the request URL.

|`pathTranslated` |Additional information about the path in the request
URL, worked out to the real path.

|`protocol` |Request protocol name and version in the form of
protocol/majorVersion.minorVersion, for example, `HTTP/1.1`.

|`queryString` |URL request string.

|`remoteAddr` |IP address of the client or last proxy.

|`remoteHost` |Fully qualified name of the client or last proxy.

|`remotePort` |Port of the client or last proxy.

|`requestURI` |A part of the URL request from the protocol name to the
request string.

|`requestURL` |URL of the request.

|`scheme` |Request pattern, for example `http`, `https`, or `ftp`.

|`serverName` |Name of the host, to which the request was sent.

|`serverPort` |Port, to which the request was sent.

|`secure` |`true` when the request was sent via the secured channel, for
example HTTPS and `false` otherwise.
|=======================================================================

In the example below, all request headers are output into the log:

code,JavaScript------------------------------------------------------
code,JavaScript
for (var c in http.response.headers) {
    Logger.info(c + ' - ' + http.response.headers[c]);
}
------------------------------------------------------

The `response` object contains the following properties and methods:

[cols="<,<",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Property/method |Description
|`status` |Current status of the response.

|`contentType` |MIME type of the response body.

|`body` |The text body sent in this response. The body must be set after
content type. Note that content length is set automatically.

|`bodyBuffer` |The binary body sent in this response, as a bytes array.
The body must be set after content type. Note that content length is set
automatically.

|`headers` |Response headers in key-value form.

|`addHeader(name, value)` |Adds a new header with the specified name and
value to the response.

|`setHeader(name, value)` |Defines a new value for the response header.

|`addCookie(cookie)` |Adds new cookies to the response.
|=======================================================================

The `cookie` object contains the following properties:

[cols="<,<",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Property |Description
|`name` |The cookie name (required).

|`value` |The current cookie value (required).

|`version` |Cookie protocol version.
|=======================================================================

In the example below, new cookie will be added to the HTTP response:

code,JavaScript-------------------------- code,JavaScript
http.response.addCookie({ 
    name : 'platypus',
    value : 'test',
    maxAge : 60*60
});
--------------------------

To delete cookie from your browser, set `0` for its `maxAge` property.
