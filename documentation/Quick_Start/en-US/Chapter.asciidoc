In this tutorial you'll learn how to create a simple business
application in JavaScript using Platypus.js. The sample source code is
avaliable for download from the Platypus.js project's website.

Please refer to the Development Guide and the Administration Guide for
more details about Platypus.js.

[[platypus.js-installation]]
Platypus.js installation
------------------------

Java Runtime and JDK 7 are required for Platypus.js applications
development.

Install the Platypus.js IDE, the Platyps.js runtime components and
Apache Tomcat 7 to enable running a web client:

* Download the Platypus.js installer bundle from the project's website
for your operating system.
* Run the installer.
* Follow the wizard's steps and install the required components.

[[the-sample-application-requirements]]
The sample application requirements
-----------------------------------

The Pet Hotel is a simple business application for of cats and dogs
hotel accounting.

The hotel's administrator role is the only user role defined for this
application.

An adminstrator can perform the following actions:

* Search for the pet owners by her/his name and display the owners list.
* Add, delete and update owner's data.
* Display an owner's pets as a list.
* Add, delete and update an owner's pets records.
* Add, delete and update the hotel attendance data for a pet.
* Display and print the owners report.

The entered data must be validated according to the following rules:

* All owner's and pet's data fields are mandatory.
* The check-in date must preceed the check-out date.

image:images/appDomain.png[Pet Hotel knowledge domain model diagram]

[[the-sample-project-creation-and-setup]]
The sample project creation and setup
-------------------------------------

During the installation process the Platypus.js IDE is configured for
the correct path to the runtime directory, Tomcat and a default database
connection. Check the platform's runtime directory on Tools Platypus
Platform menu item in the global menu.

Create a new database connection for the Pet Hotel applicaton. You can
use any of the databases supported by the platform. The easiest way is
to use H2 database, wich is supplied with the platform and does not
require any additional configuration or administration.

Use the instructions below to create the H2 datasource connection:

* Go to the Services panel.
* Select the New Connection... menu item from the Databases node context
menu.
* Select the H2 JDBC driver, provide a user name, a password and a JDBC
URL in the following format:
* Click Next button. H2 database will be started and `pet_hotel`
database will be created in the user's directory if it is not exist yet.
* Select `PUBLIC` as the connection's default schema.
* Set `pet_hotel` as a connection name.

Create a new project for Pet Hotel application and provide the project's
name and home directory. In the project's properties select the
`pet_hotel` from the list as a default Datasource.

[[defining-the-datatase-structure]]
Defining the datatase structure
-------------------------------

One way to begin building your application is to start from creating its
database structure. When using Platypus.js, you need to create a
database structure diagram.

Add a new Database structure diagram application element.

On the diagram create new database tables named `Owner`, `Pet`,
`PetType` and `Visit` according to the knowledge domain model. A numeric
primary key is automatically created for each new table. Add all the
required fields for the tables.

Create the foriegn key links by connecting foreign key fields with thie
correspondent primary keys fiels. Please note that the connected fields
must have the same data type.

[[owners-list-form]]
Owners list form
----------------

We are going to build the user inteface allowing to display the owners
list.

Create a new Form application element named `OwnersView`, check that the
JavaScript constructor for this form is also set to `OwnersView`. This
form will display the owners list.

Also create a new Form application element named `OwnerView` , check
that the constructor is also set to `OwnerView`. The owners detais will
be shown on this form. Save this form but for this moment leave it
blank.

Now lets edit the `OwnersView` form.

image:images/ownersList.png[Owners list form layout]

`OwnersView` form will contain:

* On the top of the form: the panel with the Add and Delete buttons as
well as the search text field and the Search button.
* The `ModelGrid` widget to display the owners list.

Add the header panel from the containers pallete on the form, put the
buttons and the text field from the standard components palette on the
panel. Provide meaningful names for the added components. Set texts to
the added buttons. Drag-and-drop a `ModelGrid` from the model widgets
palette on the form below the header panel and also provide a name for
it.

Next lets configure the data model for our `OwnersView` form. Data model
allows persistent data to be read and written from/to the database. In
Playpus.js data model entities are created on the basis of data sourses.
To access relational data create data sources from SQL queries.

Create a new Query application element named `OwnersQuery` with SQL to
get filtered records from the `Owner` table:

[source,Sql]
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

/**
 * Gets all owners.
 * @public
 * @name OwnersQuery
 */ 
Select t1.owners_id, (t1.firstname || ' ' || t1.lastname) As fullName, t1.address, t1.city, t1.telephone 
From Owners t1
 Where t1.lastname Like :lastNamePattern
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In this SQL query we are concatenating the `firstname` and `lastname`
fields to return an owner's full name. Use the `:lastNamePattern` to
provide a search pattern for the owner's last name.

Add `@public` anntotation to the query's header to enable access via
network from a remote data model running on a client and save the query.

Drag-and-drop it to the `OwnersView` data model. Go to the new entity's
properties and provide its name as `owners`.

Add the new data model parameter named `lastNamePattern` and connect it
to the corrsespondent parameter of the entity. We'll use this parameter
to perform search on the `Owner` database table.

image:images/ownersListDataModel.png[OwnersView form data model]

Next, bind the `ModelGrid` widget to the `owners` entity. Select the
Model binding entity parameter and select the entiy to bind. Create the
grid's columns using Fill columns context menu item. After that provide
the meaningful columns names and correct the columns captions.

`ModelGrid` widget enables rows insertions and deletions as well as
editing of its its cells. The chandes will be made in the binded data
model entity. This way we can create a simple CRUD functionality even
without any coding. For our grid we disable this feature, because we are
going to use a separate form to edit a single owner's record — disable
deletable, insertable and editable properties of the grid.

Lets write some JavaScript code for our form.

Double click on the Add button and enter the code responsible for
showing the `OwnerView` form:

[source,JavaScript]
--------------------------------------------------
/**
 * Add button's click event handler.
 * @param evt Event object
 */
form.addButton.onActionPerformed = function(evt) {
    var ownerView = new OwnerView();
    ownerView.showModal(refresh);
} 
--------------------------------------------------

In this event handler we create a new instance of the owner's details
form and show it as a modal window. We provide the `refresh` function as
a parameter to enable data model requiery when closing the owner's
details form:

[source,JavaScript]
-------------------- 
function refresh() {
    model.requery();
} 
--------------------

Double click on the Delete button and provide the code fragment
responsible for an owner's record deletion:

[source,JavaScript]
-----------------------------------------------------
/**
 * Delete button's click event handler.
 * @param evt Event object
 */
form.deleteButton.onActionPerformed = function(evt) {
    if (confirm("Delete owner?")) {
        ownersQuery.deleteRow();
        model.save();
    }
}
-----------------------------------------------------

On Delete button click we are showng a confirmation dialogue and if the
action is confirmed the current row in the owners query will be deleted.
Then all changes will be saved to the database.

Provide a handler for the `onMouseClicked` event of the grid widget:

[source,JavaScript]
------------------------------------------------
/**
 * Grid click event handler.
 * @param evt Event object
 */
form.ownersGrid.onMouseClicked = function(evt) {
    if (evt.clickCount > 1) {
        editOwner();
    }
}
------------------------------------------------

Write the `editOwner` function:

[source,JavaScript]
------------------------------------------------
function editOwner() {
    var ownerView = new OwnerView();
    ownerView.ownerID = owners.cursor.owners_id;
    ownerView.showModal(refresh);
}
------------------------------------------------

The code is seems familiar except the handling of the `ownerID`
parameter containing the grid's current owner's record identifier.

Double click on the Search button to provide the search by a last name
action logic:

[source,JavaScript]
-----------------------------------------------------
/**
 * Search button click event handler.
 * @param evt Event object
 */
form.searchButton.onActionPerformed = function(evt) {
     model.params.lastNamePattern = 
           '%' + txtSearch.text + '%';
}
-----------------------------------------------------

When a new value is assigned to a model's parameter the model's data
linked to this parameter is automaically required according to the new
value.

At this point we are ready to run and debug our application. Some test
data can be added to the database tables using our SQL query. When a
query is run the result are shown in a separate results window. You can
also insert, delete and update database records using this window.

[[owners-detalis-pets-and-visits-form]]
Owners detalis, pets and visits form
------------------------------------

Open the OwnerDetails form we've created earlier. This form will contain
the user interface related to a conrete owner, her/his pets and hotel
visits.

image:images/owner.png[OwnerDetails form layout]

Add the Name, Last Name, Address, City and Phone model `TextField`
widgets for an owner's fields. Align this components to the right. Add
`Label` components to the left of the correspondent input text field.
Provide meaningful names for all components and set the labels texts.

Drag-and-drop a `SplitPane` container from the containers palette and
set its separator orientation to vertical.

Add a panel container on the left and right sides of the `SplitPane`.
The left panel is for an owner's pets and the right side is for the
pet's visit to the hotel.

Place the Add and Delete buttons on top of the pets and the visits
panels.

Add `ModelGrid` widgets on the left and the right panels to display pets
and the concrete pet's visits list.

At the bottom of the form add Ok and Cancel buttons to save an owner's
data, as well as the pets and the pet's visits data.

At this moment we have our owner's details form mock layout. Next
configure the form's data model based on the SQL queries and write some
JavaScript code.

Add a new application element for a SQL query selecting data for the
specific owner by her/his identifier:

[source,Sql]
----------------------------- 
/**
 * Gets the owner by its ID.
 * @public
 * @name OwnerQuery
 */ 
Select * 
From Owners t1
 Where :ownerID = t1.owner_id
-----------------------------

Add a query for the pets list for the specific owner:

[source,Sql]
------------------------------------ 
/**
 * Gets the pets for concrete owner.
 * @public 
 * @name PetsQuery
 */ 
Select * 
From Pets t1
 Where :ownerID = t1.owner
------------------------------------

Next, add a query for getting all the hotel visits for the all pets of
the specific owner:

[source,Sql]
---------------------------------------------- 
/**
 * Gets all visits for concrete owner.
 * @public
 * @name VisitsQuery
 */ 
Select t1.visit_id, t1.pet, t1.fromdate,
 t1.todate, t1.description 
From Visit t1
 Inner Join PetsQuery t2 on t1.pet = t2.pet_id
----------------------------------------------

Add a simple query for selecting all pets types:

[source,Sql]
--------------------------- 
/**
 * Gets all types for pets.
 * @public 
 * @name PetTypesQuery
 */ 
Select * From PetType
---------------------------

image:images/ownerViewDataModel.png[OwnerView form data model]

Add a data model parameter `ownerId` and set its type to `Decimal`. Add
new entities based on the OwnerQuery, PetsQuery, VisitsQuery,
PetTypesQuery queries and set the correspondent entites names to
`owner`, `pets`, `visits` и `petTypes`.

Connect the `ownerID` data model parameter to the `ownerID` parameter of
the `owner` entity. In runtime this entity will contain the owner's data
selected according to the parameter value. Notice that this entity will
contain only one row.

Connect the input parameters of the `pets` and `visits` entities to the
current owner's identifier.

The `visits` entity will hold all the visits for the all pets of the
concrete owner, but we want to show on the right grid only the visits
for the currently selected pet. For this, add a filtering link between
the `pet_id` field of the `pets` entity and the `pet` field of the
`visits` entity. Notice that filtering take place on a client and does
not spawn any new database requests.

As the form's data model configuration is completed, bind the form's
model widget to the model.

Set the Model binding field property for the ModelText widgets on the
form and bind them to the name, last name, city and telephone fields of
the `owner` entity.

Create new columns for the `pets` and `visits` grids and bind this
columns to the correspondent fields of the `pets` and `visits` entities.
Provide the correct text for the columns headers.

Ulike the owners list grid the pets and visits grids will allow edit
their cell data.

Provide the ModelCombo widget as a cell component for the pet type
column on the pets grid. For this component specify the `displayField` и
`valueField` by connecting them to the `name` и `pettype` fiels of the
`petTypes` entity.

At the next step we'll write some JavaScript code for the OwnerView
form.

Double click on the OK button and insert the handler code to save the
owner's data:

[source,JavaScript]
-------------------------------------------------
/**
 * Save button's click event handler.
 * @param evt Event object
 */
form.okButton.onActionPerformed = function(evt) {
    if (model.modified) {
        var message = validate();
        if (!message) {
            model.save(function() {
                close(owner.owner_id);
            });
        } else {
            alert(message, title);
        }
    }
}
-------------------------------------------------

In the handler code snippet above validation function is invoked and if
successfull then changes are saved to the database. Write the `validate`
function stub we'll return to its code later.

[source,JavaScript]
-------------------------------------------------------------------
/**
 * Validates the view.
 * @return Validation error message or falsy value if form is valid
 */
function validate() {
    return null;
}
-------------------------------------------------------------------

Double click on the Cancel button and insert JavaScript code to perform
the form close action:

[source,JavaScript]
-----------------------------------------------------
/**
 * Cancel button's click event handler.
 * @param evt Event object
 */
form.cancelButton.onActionPerformed = function(evt) {
    form.close();
}
-----------------------------------------------------

To ensure that a new owner row is inserted add the onRequeried event
hanlder for the `owner` entity:

[source,JavaScript]
----------------------------------------- 
/**
 * Data model's OnRequired event handler.
 * @param evt Event object
 */
model.owner.onRequeried = function(evt) {
    if (!model.params.ownerId) {
        owner.insert();
    }
}
-----------------------------------------

The event handler above will be invoked on form initialization.

Now it is time to add the code for the pets and their visits management.

Insert pets Add button `onActionPerformed` event handler to add a new
pet:

[source,JavaScript]
-----------------------------------------------------
/**
 * The add pet button's click event handler.
 * @param evt Event object
 */
form.addPetButton.onActionPerformed = function(evt) {
    model.pets.insert();
    model.pets.cursor.owner = model.params.owner_id;
}
-----------------------------------------------------

Insert pets Delete button `onActionPerformed` event handler to delete a
pet:

[source,JavaScript]
--------------------------------------------------------
/**
 * Delete pet button's click event handler. 
 * Deletes the selected pet.
 * @param evt Event object
 */
form.deletePetButton.onActionPerformed = function(evt) {
    if (confirm('Delete pet?', title)) {
        model.pets.deleteRow();
    }
}
--------------------------------------------------------

Insert visits Add button `onActionPerformed` event handler to add a new
visit to the hotel:

[source,JavaScript]
-------------------------------------------------------
/**
 * Add visit button's click event handler.
 * @param evt Event object
 */
form.addVisitButton.onActionPerformed = function(evt) {
    model.visits.insert();
} 
-------------------------------------------------------

Insert visits Delete button `onActionPerformed` event handler to delete
a pet's visit:

[source,JavaScript]
----------------------------------------------------------
/**
 * Delete visit button's click event handler.
 * @param evt Event object
 */
form.deleteVisitButton.onActionPerformed = function(evt) {
    if (confirm('Delete visit?', title)) {
        model.visits.deleteRow();
    }
}
----------------------------------------------------------

Next we will provide the logic for the form validation. Edit the
`validate` function and implement it as follows to perform the owner's
and the pets and visits validation:

[source,JavaScript]
--------------------------------------------------------------------
/**
 * Validates the view.
 * @return Validation error message or empty String if form is valid
 */
function validate() {
    var message = validateOwner();
    message += validatePets();
    message += validateVisits();
    return message;
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Add owner's fields validation code:

[source,JavaScript]
--------------------------------------------------------------------
/**
 * Validates owner's properties.
 * @return Validation error message or empty String if form is valid
 */
function validateOwner() {
    var message = "";
    if (!owner.firstname) {
        message += "First name is required.\n";
    }
    if (!owner.lastname) {
        message += "Last name is required.\n";
    }
    if (!owner.address) {
        message += "Address is required.\n";
    }
    if (!owner.city) {
        message += "City is required.\n";
    }
    if (!owner.telephone) {
        message += "Phone number is required.\n";
    }
    return message;
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------

The pets validation code is as follows:

[source,JavaScript]
--------------------------------------------------------------------
/**
 * Validates pets entity.
 * @return Validation error message or empty String if form is valid
 */
function validatePets() {
    var message = "";
    pets.forEach(function(pet) {
        if (!pet.name) {
            message += "Pet's name is required.\n";
        }
        if (!pet.birthdate) {
            message += "Pet's birthdate is required.\n";
        }
        if (!pet.type) {
            message += "Pet's type is required.\n";
        }
    });
    return message;
}
--------------------------------------------------------------------

Insert the visits validation code for the currently selected pet:

[source,Javascript]
-----------------------------------------------------
/**
 * Validates visits entity.
 * @return Validation error message or empty String if form is valid
 */
function validateVisits() {
    var message = "";
    visits.forEach(function(visit) {
        if (!visit.fromdate) {
            message += "Visit from date is required.\n";
        }
        if (!visit.todate) {
            message += "Visit to date is required.\n";
        }
        if (visit.fromdate >= visit.todate) {
            message += "Visit 'from' date must be before 'to' date.\n";
        }
    });
    return message;
}
-----------------------------------------------------------------------

Please notice that the pet's visits validation must be invoked not only
before the model save action, but also on any pets grid cursor movement.
To do that, implement the `willScroll` event of the `pets` entity:

[source,Javascript]
-----------------------------------------------------
/**
 * Pet's entity cursor movement event handler.
 * @param evt Event object
 */
model.pets.onWillScroll = function(evt) {
    Logger.info('Pets scroll event.');
    var message = validateVisits();
    if (message) {
        alert(message);
        return false;
    }
    return true;
}
----------------------------------------------

The cursor will not move if the `onWillScroll` event handle will return
`false` value.

At this stage you need to run and test your application. To do that, run
the application with desktop client and direct connection to the
database. Use step-by-step code debugging to make sure your JavaSctipt
works correctly.

By default the anonymous mode is enabled, but you can activate a user's
login dialogue. For this set the correspondent checkbox in the
application project properties. The user name `admin` with `masterkey`
password are the default credentials you can use to login.

[[improving-the-owners-list-form]]
Improving the owners list form
------------------------------

In this section we are going to add a new column on the owners grid list
to display pets names.

Open for edit the `OwnersView` form layout and drag-and-drop a new Model
Grid Column widget on the owners list grid component. Set the column
name and its header text. Do not connect this column with any of the
entities fields. For this column we are going to use a separate SQL
query to retrieve the pets list and output it using the specific
JavaScript code.

Create a new query named `OwnersPets` to select the owners and their
pets. Configure this query using the visual editor. Notice that in this
query we use the `OwnersQuery` subquery. Add the `OwnersQuery` and the
`Pets` table and connect the keys fields with a link. The result SQL is
to be like the follows:

[source,Sql]
------------------------------------------------ 
/**
 * Gets the owners and their pets.
 * @public
 * @name OwnersPets
 */ 
Select q1.owner_id, t.name
From OwnersQuery q1
 Left Outer Join Pets t on t.owner = q1.owner_id
------------------------------------------------

Add the `lastNamePattern` parameter to the query and bind the parameter
to the `OwnersQuery` subquery.

Please notice that a client's data model has asynchronous nature. Thus
the queries execution results are delivered to the client
asynchronously. In the case when we need to display the combined data on
a single widget (a column cell in our application) we have to take care
about it.

image:images/ownersListDataModel2.png[OwnersView form data model]

Add the `OwnersPet` query to the `OwnersView` and set the new entity's
name to `ownersPets`. Delete the existing link between the `owners`
entity and the `lastNamePattern` parameter and bind this parameter to
the correspondent parameter of the `ownersPets` entity. This way the
parameter change will refresh the pets entity, not the `owners` entity.

The `owners` entity will be requiered by the code logic. This code will
be invoked on the event of the getting new data in the `ownersPets`
entity.

Add the `onRequired` event handler for the `ownersPets` and insert some
code to its body:

[source,Javascript]
-----------------------------------------------------
/**
 * Called then data is ready in ownersPets entity.
 * @param evt Event object
 */
model.ownersPet.onRequeried = function(evt) {         
    model.owners.params.lastNamePattern =
           model.ownersPets.params.lastNamePattern;
    owners.requery();
}
------------------------------------------------------

The owner's list data grid will be repained after the fresh data will
come to the binded `owners` entity. At that moment we'll have for sure
actual pets data because the correspondent query already have executed.

Provide the `onRender` event handler to the owners `ModelGrid` widget to
perform the specific rendering for the new `pets` column:

[source,Javascript]
-----------------------------------------------------
/**
 * Pet's column onRender handler.
 * @param evt onRender event object
 * @returns true to apply changes to the cell
 */
form.ownersGrid.onRender = function(evt) { 
    var pets = model.ownersPets.find(
                  model.ownersPets.schema.owner_id,                            evt.id);
    var txt = '';    
    pets.forEach(function(aPet) {
       if(txt.length > 0) {
           txt += ' ';
       }
       txt += aPet.name ? aPet.name : '';
    });
    evt.cell.display = txt;
    return true;
}
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The function above is invoked for every element of the owners list. We
get the owner's pet, create the string representation and render it in
the grid cell.

[[owners-report]]
Owners report
-------------

In this section we are going to create a simple report about the owners.

Create a new Report application element with the `OwnersReport` name.
Add a string parameter named `lastNamePattern` and the owners entity
based on the `OwnersQuery`. Bind the model's and the entity's
parameters.

Start Excel to edit the report template. Provide the report's header,
owners tables columns headers and the columns tags as it shown below:

[cols="<,<,<,<",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|`Name` |`Address` |`City` |`Phone`
|`${owners.fullname}` |`${owners.address}` |`${owners.city}`
|`${owners.telephone}`
|=======================================================================

Go to the `OwnersView` form and add the Report button. Change the button
name, the capion text and provide its press event handler code:

[source,Javascript]
-----------------------------------------------------
/**
 * Report button click event handler.
 * @param evt Event object
 */
form.reportButton.onActionPerformed = function(evt) {
    var ownersReport = new OwnersReport();
    ownersReport.params.lastNamePattern = 
        form.params.lastNamePattern;
    ownersReport.show();
}
-----------------------------------------------------
Here we create a new report instance, set its parameter to the similar
parameter of the`OwnersView` form and display the report.
